Analysis of species and observations in the national parks of the United States
This project is a data science exercise that consists of analyzing and visualizing the data of the species and observations in four national parks of the United States: Yellowstone, Bryce, Yosemite and Great Smoky Mountains.

### Objectives and questions
The main objective of this project is to explore the data of the species and observations in the parks and answer the following questions:

- What are the most common and rare species in each park?
- How are the species distributed by category (mammals, plants, etc.) in each park?
- How are the observations related to the category and conservation status of the species?
- Are there any differences or similarities among the parks in terms of species diversity and abundance?

### Data
The data used for this project comes from Codecademy, which provides two CSV files with the following variables:

`species.csv`:
- scientific_name: The scientific name of the species.
- common_names: The common names of the species.
- category: The category of the species (mammals, plants, etc.).
- conservation_status: The conservation status of the species according to IUCN criteria (endangered, threatened, etc.).

`observations.csv`:
- scientific_name: The scientific name of the species.
- park_name: The name of the park where the observation was made.
- observations: The number of observations of the species in a week.

### Tools
The following tools were used for the analysis:

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for creating and sharing documents with code, text, graphics, etc.
- Pandas: For data structures and operations.
- Numpy: For mathematical functions and operations.
- Seaborn: For statistical graphics.
- Matplotlib: For two-dimensional graphics.

## Results
The results can be seen in biodiversity_data_science_analysis.ipynb, which has the code, the comments and the graphs of the analysis.
